    "contents" : "- focus of the paper was not only to recognize, but to assess how well\nan activity was performed\n\n- For feature extraction we used a sliding window approach\nwith different lengths from 0.5 second to 2.5 seconds, with\n0.5 second overlap\n\n- In each step of the sliding window approach\nwe calculated features on the Euler angles (roll, pitch\nand yaw), as well as the raw accelerometer, gyroscope and\nmagnetometer readings.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles\n\n- ",
