- focus of the paper was not only to recognize, but to assess how well
an activity was performed

- For feature extraction we used a sliding window approach
with different lengths from 0.5 second to 2.5 seconds, with
0.5 second overlap

- In each step of the sliding window approach
we calculated features on the Euler angles (roll, pitch
and yaw), as well as the raw accelerometer, gyroscope and
magnetometer readings.
